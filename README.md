An extension with rich support for the [Red language](https://www.red-lang.org/), with features including the following and more:

* hint all syntax errors
* auto completion
* goto definition
* navigate to any symbol definition
* hover to view signatures
* Interpret or compile Red source file

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the extension
### 2. Install [Red](http://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html)

### 3. Turn on/off the intelligence feature

You can turn on/off the intelligence feature in the **User or Workspace Settings file (settings.json)** as follows.

For Example, turn off it:

```
"red.intelligence": false
```
That's all. 

If you want to compile the source file, do the following settings.

---

### Specify the full path of the red toolchain

For compiling Red source file, you need to configure the path to the Red toolchain in the **User or Workspace Settings file (settings.json)** as follows.

  ```
  "red.redPath": "/home/user1/tools/red-latest"
  ```

For Windows user: `c:/work/red/red.exe` or `c:\\work\\red\\red.exe` or `c:\work\red\red.exe` will all be accepted.

### Specify the output folder

You can also configure the directory for output files of the compiler. The current work space (project) directory is used by default.

(**Note**: If no work space directory, the output files are in the same folder as the Red source file.)


  ```
  "red.buildDir": "/home/user1/debug"
  ```


If you are using Linux and prefer to use the Windows version of Red through Wine until GUI support is available for Linux, you can point `red.redPath` to a small [shell script](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Visual-Studio-Code-Plugin#running-red-through-wine-on-linux).
